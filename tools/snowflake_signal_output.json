    "Your Document AI extracts data from documents, but what happens when extraction confidence is low or human validation is needed? Do you have orchestration to route exceptions, manage SLAs, and close the loop?",
    "Hiring for SOX and audit roles typically signals manual evidence collection—have you explored continuous controls monitoring and automated audit trail generation to reduce cycle time and avoid throwing more people at compliance?",
    "Your SOX automation blog was interesting—are you applying those principles internally, or is there a gap between what Snowflake evangelizes for customers and what your own finance/compliance teams actually use?",
