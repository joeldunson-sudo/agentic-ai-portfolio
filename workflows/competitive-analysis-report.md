## 5. Competitive Positioning Strategy

### When Tungsten Wins

1. **Document-Heavy Workflows**
   - Invoice processing, contract management, claims processing
   - Industries: Banking, insurance, healthcare, supply chain, public sector
   - Differentiation: 80% faster model creation with Tungsten Copilot

2. **Agentic AI Requirements**
   - Multi-agent orchestration needs
   - Knowledge discovery from unstructured data
   - Real-time decision intelligence

3. **Legacy RPA Displacement**
   - Contracts expiring with UiPath/Blue Prism
   - Budget-conscious enterprises seeking better TCO
   - Quote: "2.1% RPA displacement opportunity" in legacy installs

4. **Global Compliance**
   - Multi-region e-invoicing (China, EU regulations)
   - Industry-specific document processing
   - Regional data residency requirements

### Competitive Battles

**vs UiPath**
- **Attack:** "UiPath excels at general RPA, but for document-intensive workflows, Tungsten's IDP leadership delivers 80% faster deployment and better accuracy"
- **Defense:** Emphasize Gartner IDP Leader status, agentic AI differentiation
- **Price:** Position as cost-effective alternative for enterprise IDP needs

**vs Automation Anywhere**
- **Attack:** "AA's cloud-first is solid, but Tungsten combines cloud flexibility with 40 years of document automation expertise"
- **Defense:** IDP maturity gap, pre-trained model library advantage
- **Price:** Comparable enterprise pricing with better IDP value

**vs Power Automate**
- **Attack:** "Power Automate is great for M365 shops and citizen developers, but complex document processing and enterprise-grade IDP requires Tungsten's depth"
- **Defense:** Enterprise-grade features, compliance capabilities
- **Price:** TCO advantage for IDP use cases despite higher entry cost

---

## 6. Key Battlecards

### Objection Handling

**"UiPath is the market leader"**
- **Response:** "UiPath leads in general RPA (17.9% share), but for your document-intensive workflows - invoices, contracts, claims - Tungsten is the Gartner Leader in IDP. We accelerate model creation by 80% and deliver better accuracy where it matters."

**"We're already in the Microsoft ecosystem"**
- **Response:** "Power Automate is excellent for simple flows and M365 integration. For complex document processing with global compliance (like your China/EU operations), Tungsten provides enterprise-grade IDP that Power Automate's AI Builder can't match."

**"Your pricing is higher than competitors"**
- **Response:** "When you factor in the total cost of IDP + RPA + orchestration, our unified platform eliminates multi-vendor overhead. Customers report 30-50% efficiency gains and ROI in under 6 months."

**"We need cloud-native"**
- **Response:** "Tungsten Automation Platform (TAP) is fully cloud-enabled with hybrid flexibility. We support FedRAMP for government workloads and regional data residency - try getting that from Automation Anywhere's AWS-centric model."
